# Use 'import boto3_alternator' to make any unmodified boto3 client use
# multiple nodes of an Alternator cluster instead of just one (which you'll
# normally get if providing just one node's IP address as the endpoint URL).
#
# This is important for two reasons: High Availability (the failure of a
# single Alternator node should not prevent the client from proceeding) and
# Load Balancing over all Alternator nodes.
#
# This library provides two alternative implementations:
#   1. Every time that boto3 needs to open a *connection* to DynamoDB,
#      it will pick a different live Alternator node. When a connection
#      breaks, the destination of the new connection will be chosen again.
#   2. Every time that boto3 sends a *request* to DynamoDB, it will send it
#      to a different live Alternator node.
#
# The first implementation is best when a client has numerous threads or boto3
# "resources" - as each of those opens a different connection. But it becomes
# a problem when a client only has one or very few threads or boto3
# "resources". There, the second implementation shines because each request
# will go to a different Alternator node, instead of sending all these
# requests over an already established connection. This means that the second
# implementation is bad when the client has many threads of "resources",
# because each of these resources, instead of keeping one open connection,
# will keep many (the size of botocore's "connection pool") to many different
# Alternator nodes.
#
# Both approaches start an additional thread which periodically updates the
# list of live Alternator nodes by contacting one of the known nodes and
# asking it for a list of the rest (in this data-center).
#
# Both approaches work by "monkey-patching", or instrumenting, different
# library functions:
# 1. The first approach monkey-patches socket.getaddrinfo, so every time
#    boto3 uses it to open a new connection, it will pick a different node.
# 2. The second approach monkey-patch botocore's request-sending function,
#    botocore.httpsession.URLLib3Session.send, so that each request is sent
#    to a different node.
#
#
# To use this library, import it and then run the setup1() or setup2()
# function, like this: (pick setup1 or setup2 for the two different
# implementations):
#
#   import boto3_alternator
#
#   alternator_url = boto3_alternator_3.setup1(
#      # A list of known Alternator nodes. One of them must be responsive.
#      ['127.0.0.1'],
#      # Alternator scheme (http or https) and port
#     'http', 8000,
#      # A "fake" domain name which, if used by the application, will be
#      # resolved to one of the Scylla nodes.
#     'dog.scylla.com')
#
# The setup function returns the "endpoint URL", in this example it will be
# "http://dog.scylla.com:8000/". You will need to use this endpoint URL to
# create the boto3 resource, e.g.,
#
#    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', endpoint_url=alternator_url,
#            aws_access_key_id='???', aws_secret_access_key='???')
#
# The "fake domain", in this example, dog.scylla.com, can be any domain name,
# it doesn't need to exist - and in fact, it probably shouldn't. The setup()
# code captures any attempts to use this domain name and forwards them to one
# of the live Alternator nodes, so the real DNS is never asked about
# "dog.scylla.com".
